Computer science encompasses a wide variety of data structures that are used for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Here is a list of some common data structures:

Arrays

Linked Lists

Singly Linked Lists
Doubly Linked Lists
Circular Linked Lists
Stacks

Queues

Linear Queues
Circular Queues
Priority Queues
Trees

Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees (BST)
AVL Trees
Red-Black Trees
B-Trees
Heap (Binary Heap)
Trie (Prefix Tree)
Graphs

Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
Undirected Graphs
Weighted Graphs
Connected Components
Spanning Trees
Graph Traversals (BFS, DFS)
Hash Tables (Hash Maps)

Hash Sets

Hash Functions

Disjoint-set (Union-Find) Data Structure

Strings and Tries

Strings
Suffix Trees
Suffix Arrays
Skip Lists

Bloom Filters

Linked Hash Maps

Priority Queues (Heap-based, Fibonacci Heap)

Deques (Double-ended Queues)

Queues with Priority (Priority Queues)

LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache

Segment Trees

Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)

Spatial Data Structures

Quad Trees
Octrees
KD-Trees
R-Trees
Circular Buffers

Self-balancing Trees

Multi-dimensional Arrays

Rope (Text Editing Data Structure)

Symmetric Binary B-Trees

Cartesian Trees

Range Trees

Trie-based Data Structures (Patricia Tries, Ternary Search Trees, etc.)

Combining Data Structures (e.g., Treap, Splay Tree)

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and new data structures are developed over time. Different data structures have specific use cases and trade-offs in terms of time and space complexity, so understanding them is crucial for efficient algorithm design and problem-solving in computer science.
